Below is an adapted “adult version” of the packet. It uses more mature language and focuses on practical strategies suited for adult life contexts (e.g., work, relationships). You can adjust formatting, fonts, and add graphics as you prefer before printing. The structure mirrors the original version, but the wording and examples are geared toward adults.

1. Welcome & Introduction
How to Use This Packet:
This packet is designed to help you recognize your emotions, respond to them more effectively, and build resilience in everyday life. Work at your own pace, and revisit sections as needed.
Why Emotion Regulation Matters:
Emotions influence how we think, behave, and interact with others. By learning to understand and manage your emotions, you can improve relationships, enhance work performance, reduce stress, and increase overall well-being.

2. Daily Emotional Coping & Problem-Solving Checklist (Laminated Sheet)
Morning (Starting Your Day)
☐ Mood Check: Identify how you’re feeling (use the feelings list).
☐ Body Scan: Notice any physical tension. Take a few deep breaths if needed.
☐ Encouraging Thought: Choose a positive intention (e.g., “I can handle challenges calmly.”)
During the Day (Work or Daily Tasks)
☐ Recognize Emotions Early: Use the intensity scale (1–10) to gauge how you feel.
☐ Apply a Strategy: Deep breathing, brief relaxation, or taking a short break.
☐ Reframe Thoughts: If you notice negative self-talk, replace it with a more balanced perspective.
☐ Break It Down: If a project feels overwhelming, identify one small, manageable step.
Evening (Reflecting on Your Day)
☐ Review Emotions: Which emotions did you experience today, and how did you respond?
☐ Celebrate Progress: Recall one instance where you effectively managed a difficult emotion.
☐ Identify a Challenge: Note where you struggled and consider what you might try next time.
If Overwhelmed At Any Time
☐ Coping Toolkit: Use a physical or mental resource (a stress ball, a grounding exercise, a reminder note).
☐ Seek Support: Remember it’s okay to ask a friend, partner, colleague, or professional for help.
